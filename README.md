# Spotify

This project involves the creation of a Spotify clone using HTML and CSS. The objective is to imitate the primary interfaces and functionality of the Spotify web app leveraging these web technologies. The final product will include essential components such as the header, featured section, music player, playlist grid, playlist detail page, and browse section. It will adhere to accessibility best practices and be fully responsive across a variety of screen sizes.

# UI Inspiration

The UI design takes inspiration from Spotify's web application. 

# Assets

To replicate the look and feel of Spotify, you will need to use the following assets:
Logo: Spotify logo (SVG and PNG formats)
Icons: Library, Search, and Home icons (SVG format)
llustrations: Album art images, artist images (JPG/PNG format)
Gradients: Background gradients and overlay gradients (JPG/PNG format)

# Components Used

Your Spotify clone will be composed of the following components:
Header: This includes the Spotify logo, search functionality, and navigation links like 'Home', 'Search', and 'Your Library'.
Sidebar: This includes navigation links, album covers and titles for playlists, and the 'Get App' CTA.
Content Area: This includes a hero section with illustration, gradients, and text, a list of album covers, and a list of artist illustrations.
Player: This includes the currently playing album art, track title, artist, and playback controls.
Footer: This includes Home, About, Legal links, and social links to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
Each component should be built independently and then integrated into the complete webpage.

# HTML & CSS Concepts Used

Here are the concepts utilised in the various sections of the clone. We recommend reviewing these concepts before starting the project. The most effective way to revisit these topics is by going over your assignments and participating in weekly contests.
We've distributed HTML and CSS concepts throughout each section, and you can find a list of the concepts used below:

1) HTML Tables & Forms
2) Semantic Tags
3) CSS Display Properties
4) CSS Positioning
5) Flex & Grids
6) Bootstrap
7) Media Queries
