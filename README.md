# Spotify

This project involves the creation of a Spotify clone using HTML and CSS. The objective is to imitate the primary interfaces and functionality of the Spotify web app leveraging these web technologies. The final product will include essential components such as the header, featured section, music player, playlist grid, playlist detail page, and browse section. It will adhere to accessibility best practices and be fully responsive across a variety of screen sizes.
